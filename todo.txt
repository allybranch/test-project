To Do:
#####################   
Edit Account Info
- add query on form submission to update the user's info in the users table

Friends
- allow users to add friends (maybe on a new page or on the myprofile page) by searching by username or first and last name
- maybe create a friends database that just holds pairs of friends (ex - user1, user2)
- have a user's friends show up under the my friends tab on the my profile page

View other profiles:
- I think we can use url rewriting to be able to view other profiles. 
- So if the url would goodfilms/profile/user1 and it would show user 1's profile
- So you can click on a friend from your friends list and view their profile

Movie data
- I think it will 


Search page
- need to send some kind of select query to movies/shows table
- basically just to show and format query results from 

Miscellaneous
- should probably do some testing for the input validation stuff, I noticed sometimes the messages sometimes didn't make sense for the inputs
- need to take a look at all the requirements and make sure we do everthing / fit all those in
