To Do:
#####################   

- fix gcp hosting
- fix acctinfo page refresh -- angular
    https://www.thetechieshouse.com/angular-4-with-php-backend-angular-4-php-mysql/
- make add to list buttons functional
- api for images
- home page is feed of updates of your friends
- find db of sample data


Movie data
- I think we can probably just use the IMDB datasets for now (https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)
- They have basic info for titles (name, year, genre), but we'll have to use an API or something else later if we want descriptions or images
- I'm thinking we can take the basics file and basically turn that into a "titles" table in our database
- The IMDB file is like insanely large so we'll definitely have to trim that down somehow (I think it has Shorts and TV episodes which we probably don't need) or find another datasource

Miscellaneous -- leigh
- how to stop the submission of null values?
- add image somehow?


done:

Friends -- ally
- allow users to add friends (maybe on a new page or on the myprofile page) by searching by username or first and last name
- maybe create a friends database that just holds pairs of friends (ex - user1, user2)
- have a user's friends show up under the my friends tab on the my profile page

View other profiles: --ally 
- I think we can use url rewriting to be able to view other profiles. 
- So if the url would goodfilms/profile/user1 and it would show user 1's profile
- So you can click on a friend from your friends list and view their profile

Miscellaneous -- leigh
- add error messages for when username and password not found in database
- add error messages for register when username is already being used
- format the add friend button
- should probably do some testing for the input validation stuff, I noticed sometimes the messages sometimes didn't make sense for the inputs
- adjust the size of the input boxes in acct


Edit Account Info -- leigh
- used isset() to make sure theres values to pull from db for acct
- display the user info in the input boxes
- update the db w the chosen info
- don't allow the username to be changed
- you can see the password you're typing in the box 

Search page -- leigh
- need to send some kind of select query to movies/shows table
- then should just basically neeed to show and format query results
- formatted the add to list and made it a button. added a hover shadow. 
- added hover black to search button
- add description field?
- we need to decide how we want to display rating ie percent, stars, etc.
